Make sure to check whether each one is a post or get method:
    
Checking whether the request method is POST or GET is a common practice in web development, especially when handling form submissions. Here's why it's important:

GET Request: This method is typically used for fetching data from the server. When a user initially loads a page or follows a link, the browser sends a GET request
to the server. In your Flask route, when the method is GET, you might want to render the login form for the user to fill out.
POST Request: This method is used when the user submits a form or sends data to the server to be processed. When the user fills out the login form and clicks the
submit button, the browser sends a POST request to the server with the form data. In your Flask route, when the method is POST, you need to process the form 
data submitted by the user.
